## Recuariments

This is a _Requirements Management Tool_. The idea is that you can work in teams (projects) and add requirements to this project.

There are many things to improve/add/change:

* Change to HStore.

* Support for Use cases.

* Support for Test cases.

* A better design.

There's a version running (production) at http://recuariments.us
